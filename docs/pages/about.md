# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:<br>
who likes math and is studying artificial intelligence. I mainly studied combinatorics in math and anti-bandwidth in graph structures.

I’ve been interested in a variety of fields, including finance, healthcare, and I can understand the key considerations in those fields.

Recently, I am interested in NLP, graph domain, and recommendation systems. I am studying with the next goal of achieving results through the combination of graph theory and deep learning. Thank you! 😍
